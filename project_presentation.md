# Soccer Ball Coordinate Prediction System
## Enhanced Hybrid LSTM-GNN Approach with Player Influence Analysis

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### Challenge
- Predicting ball coordinates in soccer matches is crucial for game analysis and strategy development
- Ball tracking data is often incomplete or missing in many datasets
- Need to predict ball movement based on player positions and game dynamics
- Traditional methods fail to capture complex spatial-temporal relationships in soccer

### Objectives
- Develop a robust model to predict ball coordinates from player position data
- Create a system that works even when ball coordinate data is missing
- Incorporate player influence and team dynamics into predictions
- Enable tactical analysis through pass network visualization

---

## 2. Data Overview

### Dataset
- Match data from 5 soccer matches (match_0 through match_4)
- Player position coordinates for home and away teams
- Ball coordinates available for matches 0-3, missing for match 4
- Data recorded at high frequency (multiple frames per second)
- Format: Excel (.xlsx) and CSV (.csv) files

### Data Characteristics
- High dimensionality (20+ players Ã— 2 coordinates per player)
- Temporal dependencies (ball movement follows physical laws)
- Spatial relationships (player formations and interactions)
- Missing data and noise (tracking errors, occlusions)

## 3. Methodology

### Hybrid Approach Rationale
- Single model types insufficient for complex soccer dynamics
- LSTM: Captures temporal patterns and ball trajectory physics
- GNN: Models spatial relationships between players and ball
- Pass Analysis: Incorporates strategic team behavior
- Player Influence: Models how proximity affects ball movement

### Architecture Overview
![Architecture Diagram]

1. **LSTM Component**
   - Processes sequences of player and ball positions
   - Learns temporal patterns in ball movement
   - Captures momentum and trajectory physics

2. **GNN Component**
   - Models players and ball as nodes in a graph
   - Edges represent proximity and potential interactions
   - Learns spatial relationships and team formations

3. **Pass Analysis Component**
   - Detects passes between players
   - Creates pass probability matrices
   - Models strategic team behavior

4. **Player Influence Module**
   - Calculates player influence based on proximity
   - Determines possession and team advantage
   - Simulates realistic ball physics (inertia, maximum speed)

## 4. Training Process

### Data Preparation
- Preprocessing: Normalization, sequence creation, graph construction
- Feature engineering: Player positions, velocities, distances to ball
- Sequence length: 5 frames for temporal context
- Graph construction: Players and ball as nodes, proximity-based edges

### Training Strategy
- Train on matches 0-2, validate on match 3
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Optimizer: Adam with learning rate 0.001
- Batch size: 32
- Early stopping based on validation loss
- Model saving for best validation performance

### Challenges Addressed
- Handling variable number of players (substitutions, different formations)
- Ensuring consistent input dimensions for neural networks
- Balancing model complexity with computational efficiency
- Preventing overfitting on limited match data

## 5. Testing and Validation

### Validation Approach
- Match 3 used as validation set (not seen during training)
- Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Visual validation of predicted trajectories

### Testing on Match 4
- Complete absence of ball coordinate data
- Test of model's ability to generalize to new scenarios
- Evaluation based on physical plausibility and tactical coherence

### Ablation Studies
- LSTM-only vs. GNN-only vs. Hybrid model
- With and without pass analysis integration
- With and without player influence enhancement
